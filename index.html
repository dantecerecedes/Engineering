<h1><b>Hello, this is Dante's Website!</b></h1>
<marquee><h2><u>Welcome!</u></h2></marquee>
<h3>This is my first website.</h3>

  <h3>Today we worked on a group project.</h3>  
    
<p>
This is my first ever blog
<h2>Week 1 Blog</h2>
<p>This was the first week. We learned each other name by playing the name game. I successfully named everyone when it was my turn. We also played name bingo to learn a fact about each person. I almost was the first one to get everyones names, but ended up getting second. Our week one challenge was trying to get a marble in a bucket by holdinh pvc pipes. Each person would have to hold about a 2 foot half pipe for the ball to roll down in. At first we struggled with speed and keeping the ramp even, but we ended up winning the week 1 challenge.</p>
<h2>Week 2 Blog</h2>
<p>This week we started working on our rube goldberg projects and started designing them. We also had to bring an object to class for the week 2 challenge and make the best possible model we could of it. I used my friends playstation controller. Although I could have done bettwe, I think I did decently for the first time. Overall the website is fun to use and I hope I can get better at using it for the future.</p>

<h2>Week 3 Blog</h2>
<p>This week I learned a lot about mechanical engineering, safety, and a new website for modeling. In mechanical engineering, there are many different fields. You can go into all different types of engineering including safety engineering, software engineering, and aerospace engineering. We also learned about safety in engineering. When phyically creating things, you must wear classes, goggles, and use each tool in a certain way. Lastly, we learned about a new website called TinkerCad. We use this website to create models and test them before making them physically. It is also fun to mess around with to see how certain thing work. Last class, we used it create a model for our system that we are going to create to pop a balloon. We had to do this by only using limited materials. Today,we learned about tinkercad which is a really cool website that allows you to design and model anything you want to build. You can even have fun by using templates and editing them. Our week 3 was measuring the letter "E" on a blank sheet of paper. We had to draw and measure each side in proportion to each other. After we finished, we would trade papers and have someone cut it out for us. My proportions were off, but I learned from my mistake.</p>
<h2>Week 4 Blog</h2>
<p>This week we worked on our Rube Goldberg projects. We started by modeling them on tinkercad. Then, we made sure each proportion was the right size and made sure each unit was right. We then started cutting out the cardboard on Wednesday, and had to think of ways the shape and cut parts to make sure they were firm. On friday, we did our week 4 challenge. We had to make a boat that would carry te most weight for five minutes. My group one and we used my boat. I was on of the few that didn't use youtube, and made sure that I had as much surface tension as possible while also having strong walls. We not only lasted for five minutes, but we had the 110 grams, which was the highest weight that lasted five minutes.</p>
<h2>Week 5</h2>
<p>This week we worked on finalizing and testing our rube goldberg projects to see if they would pop  a baloon. The first day, we worked on cutting out our cardboard pieces and puttin them together. At the end of this class, we realized that using tape would not support our build. The design was the roll a baseball down a ramp which would then pull up a track connected to the balloon with a string. After the track was lifted, the train would roll down into the balloon with a needle. After realizing the tape would not be strong enough, we made a plan that we would wait unitl next class for one of our partners to bring a hot glue gun for stronger supports and connections. When everything was finally together, we tested it. It worked, but not very well. The problem was that whether or not the length of the string from the ball to the track was perfect to lift it, it would still not lift in enough to get decent momentum. We solved this by flipping the ramp the opposite direction from the track. This would create more tension and pull, which would make the track go higher, and the train go faster. When we got the train to work, we had on final problem. The needle at the end of the balloon was at a downward angle, so when it got the the balloon, it scraped it instead of poking it. We solved this by getting a thicker needle that was could bend upward. After doing this, the baloon popped on our second try. </p>
<h2>Week 6</h2>
<p>This week we started learning about computer engineering, and the different fields it consists of including electronic engineering, and computer science. We did a lab to further learn about computers themselves, by looking at their differnet parts. Our goal was so "dissect the computer" and look at and label its different parts on a paper. After dissecting, evene with direction, it was much more difficult to put the computer back together, along with all of its screws and wires. In conclusion, I think this was a very fun lab because I got to physically see all the parts so I could match their names to what they actually look like.</p>
<h2>Week 7</h2>
<p>This week we learned about bioengineering. Engineers in this field study the movement of animals in order to create projects and engineer machines that copy the same movement of these animals. They study the way these animals and parts move and function, and create copies using artifical items. THe challenge for thsi week was to create and think of our own part of an animal that we could artifically remake in the field of bioengineering. My animal part was a bee wing which I could remake with a very thin piece of aluminum. I would use clips to attatch the wings to the bee, and it would funtion by sensing muscle movement or brain waves to control to wings movement.</p>
<h2>Week 8</h2>
<p>This week we started to make a design for a rocket build. We have to design a rocket using a 2 liter soda bottle and other materials to create the wings and make it more aerodynamic. THe challenge for today was to create a flying paper that would make it into a bin on the floor. We would have to launch to paper from the second story of the 1000 building. Many people created balls of paper which they would try to make into the bin. This was a good idea, except the paper would slow down by the time it reached the bin. The best idea, which I did, was to make a plane. My plane was built for speed, so it went fast, but did not reach the bin. The closest contestants were the ones who created planes for distance. This was overall a fun challenge since I like to make paper airplanes.</p>
