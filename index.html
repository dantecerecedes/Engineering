<h1><b>Hello, this is Dante's Website!</b></h1>
<marquee><h2><u>Welcome!</u></h2></marquee>
<h3>This is my first website.</h3>

  <h3>Today we worked on a group project.</h3>  
    
<p>
This is my first ever blog
<h2>Week 1 Blog</h2>
<p>This was the first week. We learned each other name by playing the name game. I successfully named everyone when it was my turn. We also played name bingo to learn a fact about each person. I almost was the first one to get everyones names, but ended up getting second. Our week one challenge was trying to get a marble in a bucket by holdinh pvc pipes. Each person would have to hold about a 2 foot half pipe for the ball to roll down in. At first we struggled with speed and keeping the ramp even, but we ended up winning the week 1 challenge.</p>
<h2>Week 2 Blog</h2>
<p>This week we started working on our rube goldberg projects and started designing them. We also had to bring an object to class for the week 2 challenge and make the best possible model we could of it. I used my friends playstation controller. Although I could have done bettwe, I think I did decently for the first time. Overall the website is fun to use and I hope I can get better at using it for the future.</p>

<h2>Week 3 Blog</h2>
<p>This week I learned a lot about mechanical engineering, safety, and a new website for modeling. In mechanical engineering, there are many different fields. You can go into all different types of engineering including safety engineering, software engineering, and aerospace engineering. We also learned about safety in engineering. When phyically creating things, you must wear classes, goggles, and use each tool in a certain way. Lastly, we learned about a new website called TinkerCad. We use this website to create models and test them before making them physically. It is also fun to mess around with to see how certain thing work. Last class, we used it create a model for our system that we are going to create to pop a balloon. We had to do this by only using limited materials. Today,we learned about tinkercad which is a really cool website that allows you to design and model anything you want to build. You can even have fun by using templates and editing them. Our week 3 was measuring the letter "E" on a blank sheet of paper. We had to draw and measure each side in proportion to each other. After we finished, we would trade papers and have someone cut it out for us. My proportions were off, but I learned from my mistake.</p>
<h2>Week 4 Blog</h2>
<p>This week we worked on our Rube Goldberg projects. We started by modeling them on tinkercad. Then, we made sure each proportion was the right size and made sure each unit was right. We then started cutting out the cardboard on Wednesday, and had to think of ways the shape and cut parts to make sure they were firm. On friday, we did our week 4 challenge. We had to make a boat that would carry te most weight for five minutes. My group one and we used my boat. I was on of the few that didn't use youtube, and made sure that I had as much surface tension as possible while also having strong walls. We not only lasted for five minutes, but we had the 110 grams, which was the highest weight that lasted five minutes.</p>
<h2>Week 5</h2>
<p>This week we worked on finalizing and testing our rube goldberg projects to see if they would pop  a baloon. The first day, we worked on cutting out our cardboard pieces and puttin them together. At the end of this class, we realized that using tape would not support our build. The design was the roll a baseball down a ramp which would then pull up a track connected to the balloon with a string. After the track was lifted, the train would roll down into the balloon with a needle. After realizing the tape would not be strong enough, we made a plan that we would wait unitl next class for one of our partners to bring a hot glue gun for stronger supports and connections. When everything was finally together, we tested it. It worked, but not very well. The problem was that whether or not the length of the string from the ball to the track was perfect to lift it, it would still not lift in enough to get decent momentum. We solved this by flipping the ramp the opposite direction from the track. This would create more tension and pull, which would make the track go higher, and the train go faster. When we got the train to work, we had on final problem. The needle at the end of the balloon was at a downward angle, so when it got the the balloon, it scraped it instead of poking it. We solved this by getting a thicker needle that was could bend upward. After doing this, the baloon popped on our second try. </p>
<h2>Week 6</h2>
<p>This week we started learning about computer engineering, and the different fields it consists of including electronic engineering, and computer science. We did a lab to further learn about computers themselves, by looking at their differnet parts. Our goal was so "dissect the computer" and look at and label its different parts on a paper. After dissecting, evene with direction, it was much more difficult to put the computer back together, along with all of its screws and wires. In conclusion, I think this was a very fun lab because I got to physically see all the parts so I could match their names to what they actually look like.</p>
<h2>Week 7</h2>
<p>This week we learned about bioengineering. Engineers in this field study the movement of animals in order to create projects and engineer machines that copy the same movement of these animals. They study the way these animals and parts move and function, and create copies using artifical items. THe challenge for thsi week was to create and think of our own part of an animal that we could artifically remake in the field of bioengineering. My animal part was a bee wing which I could remake with a very thin piece of aluminum. I would use clips to attatch the wings to the bee, and it would funtion by sensing muscle movement or brain waves to control to wings movement.</p><br>

<h2>Week 8</h2>
<p>This week we started to make a design for a rocket build. We have to design a rocket using a 2 liter soda bottle and other materials to create the wings and make it more aerodynamic. THe challenge for today was to create a flying paper that would make it into a bin on the floor. We would have to launch to paper from the second story of the 1000 building. Many people created balls of paper which they would try to make into the bin. This was a good idea, except the paper would slow down by the time it reached the bin. The best idea, which I did, was to make a plane. My plane was built for speed, so it went fast, but did not reach the bin. The closest contestants were the ones who created planes for distance. This was overall a fun challenge since I like to make paper airplanes.</p>

<h2>Week 9</h2>
<p>This week we learned about environmental engineering. I thought it was very cool and espcially important. I really enjoyed learning about water filters because it is very important and entertaining to see how water runs through a filtering system. The most interesting part of learning about water filters was that it is actually present in our current life. We finalized our rockets and actually got to launch them. Using pressure built from a air compressor and water, we launched the rockets. We were all competing for distance, but sadly there was a big problem. It might have been the materials, the angle, or even just a fault in out designs, but all of our rockets spun out of control and went in the opposite direction. This week was very fun and I learned that it takes a lot more complexity to build a rocket than just a soda can and four teenage minds.</p>
<h2>Week 10</h2>
<p>This week we worked on makng out own bottle filters. Using what we learned about real water filtering systems, we would create out own mini version. We were separated into groups and had to see who would get the clearest water. I was paired with greg and we knew we would have to have multiple layers, the competetion was to see which arrangment would win. Our materials were cotton, plastic bottle, large rocks, small rocks, and sand. Our final arrangement we had was cotton at the bottom, then small rock, then sand, then large rock. The dirty water took a very long time the reach the end of the bottle and come out, but once it did, we actually had the clearest water of all. We would have won this challenge, but our filter was very slow, but it was very fun participating in this project. </p>
<h2>Week 11</h2>
<p>This week we learned about circuit boards and how they work. Personally, the concpet is a little confusing and where each wire goes and why also confuses me. For this week, we used tinkercad for a different reason. We used a model for electrical circuits and used a breadboard. We connected batteries to a breadboard with LED lights on it and had to connect negatives and positives correctly. We also had to wire the battery, breadboard, transmittors, and LED in the right manner. We did this in two ways. First, in a direct way to simply get the LED to light up, and then in a sequence to get multiple in repeating manner to light up. Doing this was confusing, but I am excited for when we do it in real life.</p>
<h2>Week 13</h2>
<p>This week we learned about circuit boards more extensively. ALthough some of the aspects can get ocnfusing because they are so specific, the end result is super cool. I like how just a simple power source can create patterns in the LED lights just through a bunch of tiny codes. Putting the LED in the right spots is important, especially the negative and positive slots. ALso, the resistors had to be placed in a specific manner next to the LED for it to light up. Overall, the coolest part was lining up identitcal LED lights and programming them to flash in different sequences.</p>
<h1>Semester 2</h1>
<h2>Week 1</h2>
This week we did a shark tank project. The goal of this project was to learn to make a presentation about a specific invention of a type of engineering. The presentation was supposed to be created to simulate a real life scneario in which you need to cover all aspects of an ivention invluding cost, offers, uses, market share, cost to manufacture, target audience, location of stores, etc. I liked this project because it didn't matter what type of engineering you used, and it applied to all scenarious outside of engineering in which you need to create a presentation. We did a clothes printer where our goal was to create a machine that would use ink to quickly create any design on a white t-shirt. Thos invention would solve the problem of wanting to have a shirt with a certain picture of phrase that wasn't available or was hard to find whenever you wanted. I would like to do this project again and I learned a lot from my classmates.
<h2>Week 2</h2>
This week we learned about chemical engineering. The project for this week was the make ooblek. Ooblek is a mix of cornstarch and water which is a different consistency depending on the force that is applied to it. The more pressure, the harder, and the less pressure, the more liquidy. This was really cool as making this requiered the right amount of ingredients without getting to thick or thin. It represented real chemcial engineering in terms of creating things using chemicals that have ceratin uses whether than comes to consistency of mixtures such as cements or glue, or the acidity of a chemical to help break things down. It showed me that many simple things can even require complex chemical engineering to create.



<h1>Mousetrap Car Summary</h1>
<p>For the past few weeks, we have been worming on moustrap and arduino cars. Me and my partner Burke chose to go the mehcanical engineering route and do the mouestrap car. We started off by creating a build of materials and a plan for our car along with a tinkercad and milestones. We could ot hit these milestones or follow our plan exactly because we had limitations. We wanted to make a bigger car and a longer stick to create a longer string of tension for a longer period of time. This was not possible because we only had one size stick and limited cardboard. We also could not use all the materials we wanted, therefore our tinkercad was not accurate by default. We made improvisations and created the best advancements we could in the time we had.</p>
<p>We started off with a square build with a stick running throug two straws and into discs for the axles and wheels. We had the mousetrap but had to deal with the axles and wheels before we could get to the string and engine essentially. At first, we tried to run the entire string through the full straw and then hot glue the entire gap between the stick and the hole in the disc. This, obviously, was not stable and was very messy. We made some changes such as minizmizing the amount of straw to give us more length to work with on the axle. We also cut out squares to stick the axle through which we would then hot glue to the disc to make a much more stable spinning system. Once we had this down, we cut out some horizontal rims to minimize friction. Now we had to deal with the string. We started off with two sticks hot glued side by side and attatched to the moustrap with as much string as posibble coiled aroung the back axle. This ended up failing for a few reason. These included the axle stick being lopsided, the string getting caught as it overlapped itself, the small amount of tension from the amound of string, etc. We fixed this by getting rid of a bunch of string so that it would only wrap around the back axle when we spun backward, sort of like the mehcnical toy cars that wind up. We also created a thicker stick and finally we had our final product.</p>
<p>ALthhough our car was not the most shocking or coolest by any means, I do belive it was the most consitent as it ran a full classroom on all of our tests. I was very happy with our car and glad we solved out problems with the designs. It was very fun having to get through different problems with our OWN deisgn. It made me think about all the problems engineers must have at a larger scale. When we got to the gym for the final test, we realized we had one issue with our car that we could not fix. Our car would turn gradually to the left and drift. Once the final test began, we started too close to the left wall that it ended up starting off consistently but turning into the call about halfway where our normal tests were. Overall this was a good experience and I see how limitation can be difficult to deal with at times.</p>
