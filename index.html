<h1><b>Hello, this is Dante's Website!</b></h1>
<marquee><h2><u>Welcome!</u></h2></marquee>
<h3>This is my first website.</h3>

  <h3>Today we worked on a group project.</h3>  
    
<p>
This is my first ever blog
<h2>Week 1 Blog</h2>
<p>This was the first week. We learned each other name by playing the name game. I successfully named everyone when it was my turn. We also played name bingo to learn a fact about each person. I almost was the first one to get everyones names, but ended up getting second. Our week one challenge was trying to get a marble in a bucket by holdinh pvc pipes. Each person would have to hold about a 2 foot half pipe for the ball to roll down in. At first we struggled with speed and keeping the ramp even, but we ended up winning the week 1 challenge.</p>
<h2>Week 2 Blog</h2>
<p>This week we started working on our rube goldberg projects and started designing them. We also had to bring an object to class for the week 2 challenge and make the best possible model we could of it. I used my friends playstation controller. Although I could have done bettwe, I think I did decently for the first time. Overall the website is fun to use and I hope I can get better at using it for the future.</p>

<h2>Week 3 Blog</h2>
<p>This week I learned a lot about mechanical engineering, safety, and a new website for modeling. In mechanical engineering, there are many different fields. You can go into all different types of engineering including safety engineering, software engineering, and aerospace engineering. We also learned about safety in engineering. When phyically creating things, you must wear classes, goggles, and use each tool in a certain way. Lastly, we learned about a new website called TinkerCad. We use this website to create models and test them before making them physically. It is also fun to mess around with to see how certain thing work. Last class, we used it create a model for our system that we are going to create to pop a balloon. We had to do this by only using limited materials. Today,we learned about tinkercad which is a really cool website that allows you to design and model anything you want to build. You can even have fun by using templates and editing them. Our week 3 was measuring the letter "E" on a blank sheet of paper. We had to draw and measure each side in proportion to each other. After we finished, we would trade papers and have someone cut it out for us. My proportions were off, but I learned from my mistake.</p>
<h2>Week 4 Blog</h2>
<p>This week we worked on our Rube Goldberg projects. We started by modeling them on tinkercad. Then, we made sure each proportion was the right size and made sure each unit was right. We then started cutting out the cardboard on Wednesday, and had to think of ways the shape and cut parts to make sure they were firm. On friday, we did our week 4 challenge. We had to make a boat that would carry te most weight for five minutes. My group one and we used my boat. I was on of the few that didn't use youtube, and made sure that I had as much surface tension as possible while also having strong walls. We not only lasted for five minutes, but we had the 110 grams, which was the highest weight that lasted five minutes.</p>
